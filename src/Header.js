                    APPA works by searching ADS' "astronomy" collection for {}
                    all published papers (not conference abstracts) {}
                    on which either name you enter is an author to determine {}
                    who those people have coauthored with. Then it searches {}
                    to find who those coauthors have coauthored with, and {}
                    continues iterating until it finds a link between these {}
                    growing webs of coauthorship. Once a complete {}
                    coauthorship chain is found, iteration continues until {}
                    all possible chains of that size are found.

                    This process necessarily involves many {}
                    queries to ADS. Each query involves a database search {}
                    on ADS's side, plus a network round trip, and the total {}
                    time spent can add up quickly. When possible, APPA {}
                    reuses the results of ADS queries from past searches, {}
                    which speeds up searches significantly. Despite this, {}
                    you may still face highly variable and potentially very {}
                    long wait times while a search runs.

                        Because APPA re-uses the results from past ADS {}
                        queries, papers published within the last month may {}
                        not be included in a search.

                    An important caveat in all this is that name {}
                    disambiguation is hard. If Jane and John Doe both {}
                    publish in astronomy, it isn't possible to determine who {}
                    wrote a paper published under the name "J. Doe" (barring {}
                    universal and retroactive ORCID ID adoption). APPA {}
